I am a PhD Candidate in the <a href="https://shapirolab.vetmed.ucdavis.edu" target="_blank">Shapiro Laboratory</a> at the University of California, Davis.

<br />
My bffs are Anna and John. They are my sun and my moon - they are the best mentors and friends that I could ever ask for.

<br />
I am an epidemiologist by training with interests in emerging infectious diseases, waterborne pathogens, mathematical modeling, and wildlife conservation.

<br />

Previously, I worked at the <a href="https://cwhl.vet.cornell.edu" target="_blank">Wildlife Health Lab</a> at Cornell University,
the <a href="https://nationalzoo.si.edu/global-health-program" target="_blank">Global Health Program</a> at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute, and I got my first taste of research as an undergraduate working with <a href="https://plantsciences.montana.edu/directory/faculty/1524555/david-sands" target="_blank">Dr. David Sands</a> at <a href="https://www.montana.edu" target="_blank">Montana State University</a> in beautiful Bozeman, MT.
