Welcome to my website - it's great to have you here! I grew up in Bozeman, MT and spent the first year of my undergraduate career at Montana State University. As a pre-veterinary student I accidentally found my way into a plant pathology lab, where I helped out with a project on developing a novel tool to detect mineral deficiencies in soil. One of the most influential books I read in school was [Spillover](https://www.davidquammen.com/spillover) by David Quammen, and from there I worked my way into the field of epidemiology. 

<br />

I finished my degree at Cornell University, graduating in 2016 with a B.S. in Animal Science. I subsequently worked as a research assistant for a study on limb injuries in New York State racehorses before pivoting to diseases in free-ranging wildlife and emerging pathogens in camels. I'm very excited to be in such a rapidly moving research area, and currently in graduate school I have been working on _Toxoplasma gondii_ transmission in wildlife and during pregnancy.

Outside of research I enjoy reading, lifting, learning languages, and trying new vegan recipes.
